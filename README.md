# slash
--- Like the most helpful shortcut ever for people who live in command-line git

I live in Terminal, and I constanly am `clear`ing, `ls`ing, `git status`ing, and `git diff`ing. Its annoying as hell.
So I turned my own annoyance into a everyone else's annoyance of incessantly tapping the slash keys. `---`. That's all anyone around me hears all day. TapTapTap. TapTapTapTap. Its great. 

### Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/0xc00010ff/slash.git
cd slash
sudo make install
```

### Usage: 
`--` baby slash- cleans up the window and shows the files in the current directory. Essentially `clear && ls`

`---` slash daddy- old faithful. Adds on top of baby slash by running a `git status`, but shuts the hell up if there is no git to be statused.

`----` grandmaster fucking slash. Might kill you with a spoon, might clean your house and order dinner for you. Only thing for sure is he's in control. Actually it's just slash daddy but it runs a `git diff` if there's some git to diff.

Don't even ask what happened to `-----`. My lawyers have informed me that I'm under no obligation to confirm or deny any rumors.
